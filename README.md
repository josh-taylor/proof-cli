# Proof CLI

Proof CLI will help you in building a set of HTML pages out of a group of images; we use it for proofing website designs to clients.

By default this tool uses a base template repository located [here](https://github.com/josh-taylor/proof-cli-base-template), you can swap this out when creating a proof.

## Installation

npm install -g proof-cli
```

## Usage

```
proof create image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg
```
